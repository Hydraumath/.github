# Hydraumath

## Abstract

A coastal hydrosystem is the domain where the littoral meets aquifers and where coastal and groundwater processes are coupled. The anthropic activities that impact the coastal hydrosystems (subsoil exploitation, sand removal from the coast, land use, industrial and agricultural activities) are continuously increasing and superimpose on the effects of global change (storms, relative sea rise,...). To adapt the management of coastal areas towards this situation, we need to improve our understanding of coastal hydrosystem dynamics, and especially that of the coupling between littoral and coastal aquifer dynamics. Hydraumath aims at developing fundamental knowledge and practical tools on key subjects such as coastal hydro-morphodynamics coupled to coastal groundwater dynamics, analysis of the evolution of the time-space properties of coastal hydrosystems under various anthropogenic/natural constraints.
